# User Scripts

User scripts for sites I tend to use a lot, usually to enhance repeat visits by reducing the amount of junk I need to scroll through.

These should be compatible with all the main [user script managers](https://greasyfork.org/en#home-step-1).

## [Hacker News Comment Trees](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/18066-hn-comment-trees)

Makes it possible to actually follow conversations and new comments on repeat visits to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

The number of comments on previously visited stories is displayed on story list pages.

Controls are added to the story header when there are new comments.

When you revisit a story page by clicking on its new comment count, new comments will automatically be highlighted and threads without new comments will be collapsed.

Other minor tweaks:

- An "upvoted" link is always included in the header bar to make it easier to revisit upvoted stories
- The default collapse control on the right of each comment is replaced with a collapse control on the left hand side.

## [Rllmuk Topic Ignore List (Invision 4)](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/38321-rllmuk-topic-ignore-list-invision-4)

> Metadata in this user script is configured for [Rllmuk](https://rllmukforum.com/), which doesn't use URL rewriting, but it might be portable across other Invision 4 forums which use the default theme

Allows you to hide topics and forums you're not interested in the Unread Content and Forum views.

Adds a "Toggle Ignored Topic Display" menu command to your user script manager (or the right click context menu for Greasemonkey) for unignoring topics and forums.

## [Twitter Engagement Minus](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/38200-twitter-engagement-minus)

Adds controls to manage extra "engagement" on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/).

"Retweetlikes" - Likes which appear in your feed as if they were Retweets, due to Twitter's new algorithmic timeline nonsense - are hidden by default.

Retweets and Retweetlikes in the timeline are highlighted to differentiate them more from original tweets by people you follow.
